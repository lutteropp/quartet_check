/**
 * @brief Read Phylip sequence data.
 *
 * This class provides simple facilities for reading Phylip data. It supports to read
 *
 *   * from_stream()
 *   * from_file()
 *   * from_string()
 *
 * Exemplary usage:
 *
 *     std::string infile = "path/to/file.phylip";
 *     SequenceSet sset;
 *
 *     PhylipReader()
 *         .site_casing( SiteCasing::kUnchanged )
 *         .valid_chars( nucleic_acid_codes_all() )
 *         .from_file( infile, sset );
 *
 * The expected data format roughly follows
 * [the original definition](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/sequence.html).
 * See mode( Mode ) to selected between sequential, interleaved and automatic mode.
 * We furthermore support a relaxed version (by default), where the label can be of any length.
 * See label_length( size_t ) for more information.
 *
 * Using site_casing(), the sequences can automatically be turned into upper or lower case letter.
 * Also, see valid_chars( std::string const& ) for a way of checking correct input sequences.

     * Phylip offers two variants for storing the sequences: sequential and interleaved. As there is no
     * option or flag in the file itself, there is no chance of knowing the variant without trying to
     * parse it. If one fails but not the other, it is proabably the latter variant. However, there are
     * instances where both variants are valid at the same time, but yield different sequences.
     * So, in general detecting the correct variant is undecidable, making Phylip a non-well-defined
     * format.
     *
     * In order to avoid those problems, this function explicitly sets the variant being used for
     * parsing. By default, it is set to Mode::kSequential. Use Mode::kInterleaved for the other
     * variant.
     *
     * We also offer a Mode::kAutomatic. It first tries to parse in sequential mode, and, if this fails,
     * in interleaved mode. However, as this might involve starting from the beginning of the data, this
     * is only possible with the from_file() and from_string() readers and does not work when using the
     * from_stream() reader. Also, be aware that using automatic mode is slower because of
     * implementation details induced by those limitations.
     * Try to avoid automatic mode. If possible, try to avoid Phylip at all.

     * determines after how many chars the label ends and the actual sequence begins.
     *

     * white spaces. However, in this case, there has to be at least one space or tab character between
     * the label and the sequence. After the whitespace(s), the rest of the line is then treated
